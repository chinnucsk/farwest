Farwest
=======

Farwest is a modern web application development platform.

Goals
-----

Farwest aims to allow people who don't know Erlang to create prototypes
of Erlang web applications. It also aims to allow people with no
programming background to perform many operations on the system
without any programmer guidance needed.

Farwest is still an experimental project. Documentation availability
or quality may vary.
